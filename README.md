# Movie analysis

Movie dataset analysis conducted using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slides featuring D3.js interactive visualizations are used to display some of the findings.

The approach devised by [Pablo Tamarit](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/456) is employed to embed D3.js visualizations into reveal.js slides.

## Getting started

* Open the file movies.ipynb to check the movie analysis. 

* In order to view the slides, clone or download the repository, run a local web server and open the file index.html.
